Material database
=================

A builtin database of materials is provided in the database
folder. This database is very limited. The use of customized data can
be done by defining the material data absolute path variable
file_name. The builtin database includes several standard materials
and can be consulted `here
<https://github.com/djsilva99/heatrapy/tree/master/heatrapy/database>`_. Some
folder names end with _mag. This means that the state of each point
defines if a magnetic field is applied.
