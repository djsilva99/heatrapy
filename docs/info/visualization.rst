Visualization
=============

Although the temperature data can be saved for each point and time in
a csv file, the package also allows live visualization when using the
SingleObject classes. By default, when initializing the related
objects, the plotting of the temperature begins. The different live
plot types are defined in the draw parameter. So far, one can plot the
temperature, materials, heat power sources and state for
SingleObject2D. Only the temperature can be plotted when using
SingleObject1D.
